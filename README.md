## Notice: defunct project

Now with much more experience in lua, I'd approach some things in this differently but do not want to rewrite it. Other delaunauy triangulators exist they are just less transparent about how they work, but are more reliable in the end.

# Sweep-circle Delaunay Triangulation
(and voroni diagrams)

In blue is the triangulation; in red are the voronoi cells derived from it. The point locations are purely random.

[Video of the process](https://i.imgur.com/azsskqC.mp4) throttled to ~10 points per second

## Disclaimers
1) This is not *quite* a library! It's a reference implementation that *can* be used and drawn from, but I stopped developing this once it satisfied the needs of the project I was using it for.
    * The outside of the triangulation is left unfinished (the final hull will not be convex).
    * Colinear points are not guarded against
2) The code displayed has been modified slightly to break some ties it has to the codebase I developed it in. These changes are minor and should not impact the way the code functions (e.g. different `require` paths), but they are untested nonetheless.
3) This occasionally uses Luau syntax and flavors.
4) Benchmarks, videos, and screenshots are from inside a game that this code is used in, so forgive the backgrounds :^).

## Example Usage
```lua
	local DPoint = require(--[[Path to DPoint]])
	local Delaunay = require(--[[Path to Delaunay folder]])

	local k = 100
	local points = table.create(k)
	for i = 1, k, 1 do
		points[i] = DPoint.new(math.random() * 1000, math.random() * 1000)
	end

	--Do everything
	local Cells, Edges, QEdges, CircumCenters = Delaunay.Voronoi(points)
	--Just triangulate
	local QEdges, O = Delaunay.Triangulate(points)
```

## Choice in algorithm:

We initially used the classic Divide-and-Conquer delaunay algorithm, but persistent issues realted to ultra-high-aspect-ratio triangles on dense point sets (~3000 points in a 2,000x2,000 square) could not be resolved; ultimately we concluded that Roblox's Luau optimizations were the cause. It's unknown if these issues would persist in other Lua environments. The Sweep-Circle algorithm was selected because it's unlikely to form such triangles, and indeed we do not run into this type of issue anymore.

This implementation is based on the Sweep-Circle algorithm in [this paper](https://cglab.ca/~biniaz/papers/Sweep%20Circle.pdf). We utilize the [QuadEdge data structure](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/andrew/scs/cs/15-463/2001/pub/src/a2/quadedge.html) for navigating the triangulation's topology. Our specific implementation of QEdges comes from [this repository](https://github.com/jtwaugh/Delaunay), which in turn used the aformentioned QuadEdge page for its implementation.

## Performance

It's... reasonable, considering the language. Function inlining, real arrays, and access to array-pointer logic would make this a whole lot faster.

These samples were taken from an in-game benchmark; point distribution is purely random from (0, 10,000]

Points Ct. | Time (s)
----- | -----
55,000 | 16.3269
45,000 | 11.8009
35,000 | 8.2465
25,000 | 4.9367
5,000 | 2.5130
